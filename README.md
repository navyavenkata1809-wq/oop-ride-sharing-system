# Multi-Language Ride Sharing System 

A comprehensive implementation of a Ride Sharing System designed to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles across two distinct paradigms: compiled/static (C++) and dynamic/message-passing (Smalltalk).

## 🚀 Overview
This project fulfills the requirements for a class-based system involving Drivers, Riders, and various Ride types. It showcases how encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are handled in different programming environments.

## 🛠 Features
- **Ride Hierarchy:** Base `Ride` class with specialized `StandardRide` and `PremiumRide` subclasses.
- **Dynamic Fare Calculation:** Polymorphic fare logic based on ride distance and type.
- **User Management:** Encapsulated `Driver` and `Rider` classes managing ride histories.
- **Cross-Platform Logic:** Identical business logic implemented in both C++ and GNU Smalltalk.

## 💻 Technical Implementation
### C++ Requirements
- Compiler: C++11 or higher.
- Key concepts: Virtual functions, pointer-based polymorphism, and STL vectors.

### Smalltalk Requirements
- Environment: GNU Smalltalk (gst) or JDoodle Smalltalk runner.
- Key concepts: Message passing, image-based execution, and OrderedCollections.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `ride_sharing.cpp`: C++ Source Code
- `ride_sharing.st`: Smalltalk Source Code
- `Report.md`: Detailed analysis of OOP principles used.
